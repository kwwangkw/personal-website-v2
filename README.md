# Welcome to Kevin Wang's Personal Website

This project is an iteration of Kevin Wang's personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JS

To get started with the development server:

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost.

## Building for production

To build an optimized version of the CSS, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn run production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
